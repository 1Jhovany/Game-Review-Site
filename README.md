# Reviews Site
Opinions. You know the saying...everyone has one. And the Internet has made them easier to consume, or ignore. Acquisitions, Inc. has many, many products from its years of, well, acquiring things. They have asked you to build a reviews site for some of their current products. The data gathered will help them gain insight into their customer base and the products they have come to enjoy...or enjoy less.
